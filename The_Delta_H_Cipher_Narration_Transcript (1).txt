This is the Delta-H Cipher.
The hidden formula behind all communicative precision.
At its core: Utility equals Delta times H.
Delta — Belief Update Strength.
H — Contextual Entropy.
U — Communicative Utility.
When Delta rises, belief shifts dramatically.
When H is high, uncertainty invites update.
But when either is zero, utility collapses.
So remember:
Speak only when Delta > 0 and H > 0.
Anything else is just pragmatic noise.
Language is not random. It is encrypted with entropy.
